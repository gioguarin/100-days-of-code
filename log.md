# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 3rd, 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Filmed my intro video for the first time, updated my twitter and github account. 

**Thoughts:** I started working on the HTML and CSS portion of the free code camp course earlier this week. It was only today that I realized I should probably move the daily challange over to my main account that I wanted to bring the activity over too.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
