# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 3rd, 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Filmed my intro video for the first time, updated my twitter and github account. Video creation and editing is a little rusty, but overall practice makes perfect. 

**Thoughts:** I started working on the HTML and CSS portion of the free code camp course earlier this week. It was only today that I realized I should probably move the daily challange over to my main account that I wanted to bring the activity over too. The challange also pushed me to finally pull the trigger into buying a basic Mac Mini for video editing since im using my cellphone for video recording to start out with.
