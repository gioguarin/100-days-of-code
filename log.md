# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 3rd, 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Filmed my intro video for the first time, updated my twitter and github account. Video creation and editing is a little rusty, but overall practice makes perfect. 

**Thoughts:** I started working on the HTML and CSS portion of the free code camp course earlier this week. It was only today that I realized I should probably move the daily challange over to my main account that I wanted to bring the activity over too. The challange also pushed me to finally pull the trigger into buying a basic Mac Mini for video editing since im using my cellphone for video recording to start out with.

### Day 2: December 4rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Just reached the animation portion on the "Applied Visual Design" course. Less than 13 challanges to complete the course

**Thoughts:** Im starting to see the really cool features that can be done with the design aspects for CSS and I havent even really scratched the surface yet. Im looking forward to tomorrows session that will wrap up the Visual Design course and start working on the Applied Accessibility challanges.
